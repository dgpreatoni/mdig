This file outlines the steps for building the Windows distributable.
It assumes you already have the development environment and all files
compiled correctly from GRASS and MDiG.

1. You need to download the ImageMagick installer from:

http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php

Then you need to update the variable IMAGE_MAGICK_INSTALLER
with the name of the installer file.

2. You need to install the NullSoft Installer System:

http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Download

and download the untar and unzip plugin:

http://nsis.sourceforge.net/UnTGZ_plug-in

(place the dll into the NSIS plugins directory)

3. Then run the batch file MDiG-Packager.bat - this will collect all
the needed files and build up the directory structure that's installed
on the enduser's system.

4. Open the nsi MDiG-GRASS-6.4dev-Installer inside the NSIS system
and compile.

5. If it successfully compiles you should now have a setup exe!

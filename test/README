If you wish to run the unit tests for MDiG while developing code, then run grass
on the grass_location/PERMANENT sub-directory (in GRASS terminology,
"grass_location" is the location, and PERMANENT is the mapset). This is a simple
XY coordinate datum and has mapsets for each individual test.

When running MDiG in test mode, it expects to be in the correct GRASS location
mentioned above. You also have to specify the model repository with all the test
models (test/repository).

MDiG runs through tests for the grass modules, and tests within the
framework. Then it runs through full models and tests them for expected
behaviour.

Example:

 $> grass65 ~/src/mdig/test/grass_location/PERMANENT
 GRASS 6.5.svn (grass_location):~/src/mdig/mdig> mdig.py runtests \
                                      -r ~/src/mdig/test/repository

Note - currently ONLY models are run, more rigarous tests are
needed:
* More model files that more thoroughly test the potential model types.
* Unit tests for components within MDiG.
* Comparison of the output maps from various models versus what the expected map
  should look like.

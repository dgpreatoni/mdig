If you wish to run the unit tests for MDiG while developing code, then install
nosetests for python which is a testing framework, and optionally "coverage"
which is to measure the code coverage of tests:

 easy_install nose
 easy_install coverage

Then if you go to the mdig program directory (mdig/ from the root of the source)
and run:

 nosetests -v mdig/tests/Model.py

Or to run with code coverage analysis:

 nosetests -v --with-coverage mdig/tests/Model.py

You'll run a bunch of tests to check everything's working correctly.

Note - currently only basic tests are run, more rigarous tests are
needed:
* More model files that more thoroughly test the potential model types.
* More coverage in unit tests for components within MDiG.
* Comparison of the output maps from various models versus what the expected map
  should look like.

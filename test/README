If you wish to run the unit tests for MDiG while developing code, then run grass
on the grass_location/PERMANENT sub-directory. This is a simple XY coordinate
datum and has mapsets for each individual test.

When running MDiG in test mode, it expects to be in the correct GRASS location
mentioned above. You also have to specify the model repository with all the test
models (test/repository).

MDiG runs through tests for the grass modules, and tests within the
framework. Then it runs through full models and tests them for expected
behaviour (Note: currently ONLY models are run, more rigarous tests will be
needed eventually).

Example:

 $> grass65 ~/src/mdig/test/grass_location/PERMANENT
 GRASS 6.5.svn (grass_location):~/src/mdig/mdig> mdig.py runtests \
                                      -r ~/src/mdig/test/repository

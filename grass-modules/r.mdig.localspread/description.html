<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<EM><b>r.mdig.localspread</b></EM> - contiguous dispersal based on a annual (or
other time-step) radial spread rate, which can be constant or set from a map.<br>

<H2>NOTES</H2>

When the spread rate is less than the map resolution, and when stochastic spread
is enable, we use a linear response for describing the chance of spread to a
neighbouring cell.  This response is not the mathematically correct solution
however, as there is a greater area towards the border of a cell in which a
population could exist, thus there is a greater chance the population's explicit
location is close to the border when assuming a uniform probability across the
entire cell.  Conversely, there is less chance that it will need to travel all
the way from the centre of a cell to reach the next.  The response would be
closer to a logarithmic curve.  However, we feel that a rigorous mathematical
treatment of this aspect of dispersal models is not necessary as it is unlikely
to improve the model given the uncertainty that often exists.

If you wish to run the unit tests for MDiG while developing code, then go to
the mdig program directory ('mdig/' from the root of the source) and run:

    nosetests -v

Or to run with code coverage analysis:

    nosetests -v --with-coverage

You'll run a bunch of tests to check everything's working correctly.

Note - currently only basic tests are run, more rigorous tests are needed
(although this has been greatly improved over the last year):

* Additional model files that more thoroughly test the potential model types.
* More coverage in unit tests for components within MDiG.
* Comparison of the output maps from various models versus what the expected map
  should look like. For modules, create before and after maps and make sure they
  have no difference,implement as a shell script to be run within GRASS.

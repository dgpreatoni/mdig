Testing plan

Create separate tests for framework and modules

For modules, create before and after maps and make sure they have no difference,implement as a shell script to be run within GRASS.

For the framework, implement a GRASSInterface stub that behaves similarly, but
doesn't actually run commands or require GRASS. Implement as Python. Will need
to store a repository of maps that exist. Then use pyunit

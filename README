MDiG - Modular Dispersal in GIS

== Requirements ==

General:

* GRASS 6.4 or later, hasn't been tested with the new GRASS 7.0

    http://grass.itc.it/download/index.php

* GDAL 1.6.0 or later (earlier versions have bugs)
    Although it is a GRASS requirement instead of a direct MDiG one, stuff can
    break if you have earlier buggy versions. Unfortunately this isn't
    automatically included in many major linux distributions yet (as of 2009)

For Python based MDiG controller, the following python packages (with Ubuntu
package name in brackets):

* configobj (python-configobj)
* lxml (python-lxml)
* ImageMagick's convert utility (imagemagick)

For grass modules:

* GNU Scientific Library (libgsl, libgsl0-dev)

== Feature requests ==

These are the requests that I've had for MDiG to support:

* [PRIORITY] Keep track of area treated by management strategies.

MDiG - Modular Dispersal in GIS

== Requirements ==

GIS requirements:

* GRASS 6.4RC5 or later, hasn't been tested with the new GRASS 7.0.
    In particular, we recommend an SVN snapshot as RC5 has an annoying
    g.region issue that can be confusing for new users.

* GDAL 1.6.0 or later (earlier versions have bugs)
    Although it is a GRASS requirement instead of a direct MDiG one, stuff can
    break if you have earlier buggy versions. Unfortunately this isn't
    automatically included in many major linux distributions yet (as of 2009)

MDiG controller requirements. The following packages (with Ubuntu
package name in brackets) are needed:

* configobj python library (python-configobj)
* lxml python library (python-lxml)
* ImageMagick's convert utility (imagemagick)
* simplejson (python-simplejson)
* DateUtil (python-dateutil)

For grass modules:

* GNU Scientific Library (libgsl, libgsl0-dev)

== Feature requests ==

These are the requests that I've had for MDiG to support:

* [PRIORITY] Keep track of area treated by management strategies.
